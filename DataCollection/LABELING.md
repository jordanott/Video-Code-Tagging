# Labeling Standards

The image labeling tool is available [here](http://codeml.mlatlab.org:42224/). We are interested in video frames containing Java code. Please enter a user name so we can track your work (this is required).

### Buttons ###
1. "Yep that's java code!"
  * If the IDE/text editor fills the screen and Java code is visible
  * Java code is the primary focus of the frame
2. "There's code, but it's not the majority of the screen"
  * Java code is visible in the frame
  * Code is partially obstructed by another window
  * There are other windows open in the frame  
3. "There's code but it's hand written"
  * Java code is visible in the frame
  * It is hand written code  
    * White board
    * Drawn on screen
4. "That's not Java code"
  * Anything but Java code
  * Blank IDE
  * Other programming languages

Certain buttons are not mutually exclusive. For example, if there is hand written code that is partially obstructed. You should check both number 2 and 3.
